# Git and GitHub

---

## Git

- **What it is:** A **version control system (VCS)**.
- **Purpose:** Helps developers track changes in code, go back to earlier versions, and collaborate with others without overwriting work.
- **Where it works:** On your **local computer**.

### Key Features:

- Tracks file history.
- Lets you create **branches** for new features.
- Merge changes safely.
- Work offline.

ðŸ‘‰ **Example:** If you are coding and mess up, you can roll back to a previous commit.

---

## GitHub

- **What it is:** A **cloud-based hosting platform** for Git repositories.
- **Purpose:** Makes it easy to share code, collaborate with others, and store projects online.
- **Where it works:** On the **internet**.

### Key Features:

- Stores your Git projects online.
- Provides **pull requests, issues, and project boards** for collaboration.
- Lets multiple developers contribute to the same repo.
- Integrates with CI/CD, deployment, and tools like **GitHub Actions**.

ðŸ‘‰ **Example:** If you finish a project on your computer (Git), you can push it to GitHub to share with others or work together as a team.

## âš¡ In Short

- **Git** = Tool for version control (**local**).
- **GitHub** = Platform for hosting Git repositories (**online**).

# Version Control in Git

**Version control** is a system that tracks changes in files and manages different versions of a project over time.

---

## How Git Does Version Control

- **Tracks changes**: Every time you `commit`, Git saves a snapshot of your project.
- **History**: You can go back to any previous commit if something goes wrong.
- **Branches**: You can create separate branches to work on new features without affecting the main project.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can contribute without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.

---

## Example

Imagine you are coding a website:

- **Commit 1:** You add the homepage.
- **Commit 2:** You fix a typo.
- **Commit 3:** You add a contact page.

If a bug appears in commit 3, you can roll back to commit 2.

---

## âš¡ In Short

**Version control in Git = saving snapshots (commits), managing history, branching, and collaborating effectively.**

---

# Collaboration in GitHub

**Collaboration** means working together on the same project with other people.

---

## How Collaboration Works in GitHub

- **Share code** in one repository.
- **Work on different branches** without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.
- **Submit pull requests** to propose changes.
- **Review code** and give feedback.
- **Track issues** and assign tasks.

---

## Example

- You and your friend are building a website.
- You work on the **frontend branch**, your friend works on the **backend branch**.
- Later, both changes are merged into the main project through **pull requests**.

---

## âš¡ In Short

**Collaboration in GitHub = team members contributing, reviewing, and managing a project together.**
